<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Carlos Sanchez and I'm a student here at EBHS. I am also the class of 2021. I went to the oriantation at the gym and learned where I had to go and what I had to do. Before school actually started I was practicing on the East Blades Freashman footbal team and I also learned where the bacement was and the career center, and where the trainer Billy was so if I had any questions about my gear or if anything was broken I would go to him.</p>
<p>As practice went on I had to go earlier and stay later then what I was used to. All the conditioning coach put us through was worth it first we learned the streches and what we were representing and that losing was not an option. Then we went into positions indivisual positions I went to reciver others came with me and the rest went to what they knew they were good at and what they thought they were good at after a good few weeks of offence we went into indivisual defence and I joined safety(last line of defence) some came with me others went to corner, insidebacker, and outsidebacker.</p>
<p>After using 4/5 of summer we went into teams so it was offence against defence I went on defence and others did too. We didn't have our pads at the time so we couldn't hit eachother so we had to wrap our arms around them and hold them still untill the coach yelled, "Break" or he blew the whistle. Then we got our pads a couple weeks later and we did hitting drills with the ball carrier on one side and the tackler on the other. You had to meet in the middle and the ball carrier had to give a nice little jog and if you went faster then the tackler coach would get mad. Then we did the tunnle where the ball carrier was on one side and the tackler was on the other, but there was linemen only 2 one was offence and the other was defence. The offensive linemen had to block the defensive linemen while the ball carrier had to get to the other side with the tackler trying to tackle him.</p>
<p>We did special teams and I went on kickoff team, punt, and punt return. Then I was kicked off both teams except for kickoff. We won our first scrimmage against our East Blades JV, and we also won our scrimmage against shafter, and we just won our first game against the Delano Tigers the score was 28 to 6 the date was 8-24-17</p>
<p>This was about me and who i am i hope you enjoied.</p>
